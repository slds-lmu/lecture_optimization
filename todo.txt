task:

* examples for optimization of linear regression and logreg with first order techniques
* dont focus too much on the data and a "proper" benchmark. data could evem be "random"
  we are also fine with 1 example MAYBE we can vary n and p --- BUT looking at the algorithmi effect comes first
* varying the condition number of X makes

a) linear regression
    direct solution 
    gradient descent
    wanna show: directs solution is much faster

b) logreg
    GD
    GD + momentum
    using step size control
    could also do SGD
