## Slides PDFs

This directory contains all PDFs that are generated by CI. There is just one simple rule for this directory:

__DON'T PUSH ANYTHING MANUALLY IN HERE!__

If you want to view your changes locally do the following:
1. Go into the subdirectory of your slides, e.g. `slides/ml-basics`
2. Call `make`
3. View the slides created in the subdirectory
