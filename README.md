## How to create a new website repository?

1. Create a new repository with the name `lecture_xyz` and select `slds-lmu/lecture_template` as template repository.
2. Start editing everything to suite your needs. For important (editing) workflows see the `README` files in the directories `slides`, `exercises`, and `code-demos`.
3. __Note:__ When creating new subchapters, it is important to copy the `Makefile` from one of the existing subchapters into the new one! Otherwise, the automatic rendering will not work.

## How to get started with your new lecture repository?

1. The very basic structure of the template contains
    1. `slides`: Raw `.tex` files of your lecture. PDFs are rendered automatically and moved to `slides-pdf`.
    1. `exercises`: Raw `.tex` exercise files. PDFs are rendered automatically and moved to `exercises-pdf`.
    1. `code-demos`: Raw `.tex` files for code demos. PDFs are rendered automatically and moved to `code-demos-pdf`.
    1. `quizzes`: Raw `.csv` files for quizzes.
    1. `cheatsheets`: Material for cheatsheets (images, source, etc.).
    1. `latex-math`: Submodule included from `github.com/slds-lmu/latex-math`.
    1. `style`: All relevant style files.
1. Each folder contains a `README.md` with more details.

## General editing workflow

1. We have two branches, the `main` and `release` branch.
1. Work is exclusively done in a subbranch of the `main` branch!
1. When you have finished a task, write a short understandable commit message, the smaller and more precise your commit is the better. __PLEASE DO NOT FORCE PUSH PDF FILES!__ PDFs are rendered automatically via an actions workflow. If you want to skip CI add a tag `[skip ci]` to your commit ([details see here](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-08-github-actions-skip-pull-request-and-push-workflows-with-skip-ci/)).
1. Create a PR to the `main` branch and describe what you have done, reference issues, etc. Also assign a reviewer if necessary.
1. The responsible person for the lecture then merges the PRs.
1. A release is done once a while when enough new content was added. Therefore, the main branch is merged into the `release` branch.

More workflows are described in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ayDlrDIAGxiUy6UXE4aDc1NIWG7bPACT8PGcvkWfOrc/edit#heading=h.esnnvwml8s4u) gdoc (in German). If you don't have permission, ask one of the responsible pearsons.
