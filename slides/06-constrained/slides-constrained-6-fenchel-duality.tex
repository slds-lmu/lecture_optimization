\begin{vbframe}{Constrained minimization and dual norms}

Consider the problem of norm minimization under linear constraints
in its primal form:

\begin{eqnarray*}
 \min_{\xv \in \R^d} && \| \bm{x} \| \\
\text{s.t. } &&  \bm{G} \bm{x} = \bm{h}\,,\\
\end{eqnarray*}

where $\| \cdot \|$ is some norm function. For instance, if the norm is the $L1$ norm, this problem is the famous  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_pursuit
}{\beamergotobutton{basis pursuit}} problem.

\textbf{Question:} Is there a more straightforward way to solve constrained optimization problems involving norms?

Here, the concept of the dual norm from functional analysis can be helpful.


\textbf{Definition:}  Let $\| \bm{x} \|$ be the norm of $\bm{x}$. Then the dual norm $\| \bm{x} \|_*$ is defined as 

\begin{equation*}
 \| \bm{x} \|_* = \max_{\|\bm{z}\| \le 1} \bm{z}^T\bm{x}  
\end{equation*}

Using this definition, one can show that if $\| \bm{x} \|$ is a norm and $\| \bm{x} \|_*$ is the dual norm
of it, $\| \bm{z}^T \bm{x} \| \le \| \bm{z} \| \| \bm{x} \|_{*}$ holds.

\lz

\textbf{Examples:} The dual norm of the Lp norm $\| \cdot \|_p$ is the
Lq norm $\| \cdot \|_q$ where it holds that $1/p + 1/q = 1$.
